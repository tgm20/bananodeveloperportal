# bananodeveloperportal
The Banano Developer Portal is an open-source library that includes other Banano open-source projects to make it easier for others to contribute to Banano projects. The Portal allows for any developer even a non banano developer to find projects to contribute to, thus keeping projects that would have closed down alive.
